# timecop-plotter

This repo contains scripts to visualize data collected by [Time Cop](https://github.com/hamaluik/timecop) outside of the very handy app.
It is of course very specific to my projects and taste for visualization but feel free to fork this repo and use it as a basis for your data.

## Usage

Export data from the app. This will give you a .csv file that serves as the input for the gen_plot.py script. Call `python gen_plot.py --help` for more options.
As of today (03/08/21), only a pie chart plot is implemented but more is to come.
